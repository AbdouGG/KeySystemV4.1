/*
  # Fix checkpoint verification policies

  1. Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow public access for checkpoint verification
    - Add policies for inserting new checkpoints
    - Modify existing policies to be less restrictive

  2. Security
    - Maintains basic security while allowing necessary public access
    - Ensures checkpoint verification can work without authentication
